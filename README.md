# Behavior In The Wild

*"Nothing in Nature is random. A thing appears random only through the incompleteness of our knowledge."* - Baruch Spinoza

Our aim is to explore the Behavior Modality. This involves explaining, predicting, and optimizing human behavior in the real world, especially, from the context of marketing, advertising, and computational social science.

Behavior as a modality<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> occurs in the process of communication. Communication includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228933425_On_the_annotation_of_the_multimodal_behavior_and_computation_of_cooperation_between_modalities). This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. Communication can be seen as being composed of seven modalities (Fig. 1): (the communicator, message, time of message, channel, receiver, time of effect, and effect). These modalities may vary independently of each other [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00359), [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10995), [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00378) and carry signals about each other [[5]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.139/), [[6]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.608/), [[7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00942). The message as a modality carries information from the communicator to receiver and encodes information generated by the communicator. Similarly, behavior (*aka* effect) as a modality carries information from the receiver and encodes information generated by the receiver. This is often a continuous cycle, where behavior generated in the previous cycle becomes the message of the next cycle, thus forming a conversation.

Communication involves five modalities (shown in the diagram below): (1) Speaker, (2) Content, (3) Channel, (4) Receiver, (5) Behavior (Effect). One can also include other factors in these five: (6) Time of sending (7) Time of receiving.

Therefore, from the above five modalities, we can get the following problems:
- Behavior Simulation: How will a certain audience behave for a certain message sent by a certain sender at a sender time over a certain channel?
- Customer Behavior Optimization with content as hook: How should a message be constructed such that it gets a certain behavior from a certain audience?
- Audience Optimization: Who should a message be sent to in order to get a certain effect?
- Sender Optimization: Who should send a message to get a certain effect?
- Time Optimization: What time and what frequency should a message be sent so that it gets a certain effect?
- ....
