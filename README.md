# Behavior In The Wild
*"Nothing in Nature is random. A thing appears random only through the incompleteness of our knowledge."* - Baruch Spinoza

Our aim is to explore the Behavior Modality. This involves explaining, predicting, and optimizing human behavior in the real world, especially, from the context of marketing, advertising, and computational social science.

Behavior as a modality[^1] occurs in the process of communication. Communication includes all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another [[1]](#footnote1). This includes all forms of expression, such as words, gestures, speech, pictures, and musical sounds. Communication can be seen as being composed of seven modalities ([Fig. 1](#fig:factors-of-communication)): (the communicator, message, time of message, channel, receiver, time of effect, and effect). These modalities may vary independently of each other [[2]](#footnote2), [[3]](#footnote3), [[4]](#footnote4) and carry signals about each other [[5]](#footnote5), [[6]](#footnote6) [[7]](#footnote7). The message as a modality carries information from the communicator to receiver and encodes information generated by the communicator. Similarly, behavior (aka effect) as a modality carries information from the receiver and encodes information generated by the receiver. This is often a continuous cycle, where behavior generated in the previous cycle becomes the message of the next cycle, thus forming a conversation.

[^1]: A *modality* is defined in terms of information, such that a modality is a medium through which information is conveyed [[7]](#footnote7), [[8]](#footnote8), [[9]](#footnote9). Similarly, a multimodal distribution is defined as having more than one peak in the probability distribution describing the nature of information.
